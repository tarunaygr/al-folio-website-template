Hi! Welcome to my website. I'm Tarun Ayyagari, a computer science enthusiast. I'm from Hyderabad, India. This website is where I post my thoughts, projects and other fun and interesting computer science related topics.
<h1>Interests</h1>
I'm interested in pretty much all things computer science ranging from theoretical computer science to latest tech updates. I specialize in Computer Security and Game Development. They are somewhat disjointed fields so I'm always looking for ways to bring them together. If you are interested in either (or both) of these fields, reach out and we can get in touch!



<!-- \[TO REMOVE FOLLOWING\]
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
