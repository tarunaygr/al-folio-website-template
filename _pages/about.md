Hi! Welcome to my website. I'm Tarun Ayyagari, a masters in science computer science student at [Arizona State University](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/graduate-computer-science/). I'm from Hyderabad, India. I'm into video games, anime, TV shows and movies. 
<h1>Interests</h1>
I'm interested in Computer Security and Game Development. They are somewhat disjointed fields so I'm always looking for ways to bring them together. If you are interested in either (or both) of these fields, reach out and we can collaborate!

<!-- \[TO REMOVE FOLLOWING\]
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
