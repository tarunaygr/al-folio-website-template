  abstract={The most important elements of block ciphers are nonlinear functions known as substitution boxes (S-boxes). S-boxes with weak cryptographic properties are vulnerable to attacks by various cryptanalysis techniques. Cellular Automata has been used to design S-boxes with good cryptographic properties such as nonlinearity, differential uniformity, balancedness, etc. Cellular Automata based S-boxes also have low implementation cost due to their highly parallel nature. In this work, we explore an approach of using Cellular Automata based semi-bent Boolean functions to generate S-boxes. Genetic algorithms have been used extensively to generate CA based S-boxes. Here we explore the use of Reinforcement Learning algorithms that uses relatively well understood and mathematically grounded framework of Markov Decision Processes as an alternative to genetic programming.},
