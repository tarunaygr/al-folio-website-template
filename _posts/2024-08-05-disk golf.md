Welcome to my series of writeups for n00bzunit3d 2024 capture-the-flag competition. In this post, we look at the `forensics/disk golf` challenge. The challenge gives us a `.img` file. These files are usually disk dump files. First thing we did was to open the file in  <a href="https://www.lsoft.net/disk-editor/">Active@ Disk Editor</a> to inspect the file contents. We did a search for the usual suspects `n00bz`, `flag.txt` and got lucky with the latter.
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 col-lg-12">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/n00bzunit3d/active_disk_editor.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

There seems to be a file called `flag.txt` present in the disk dump.

We turn to <a href="https://www.autopsy.com/">Autopsy</a> which allows us to explore the file system in the img file.


<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 col-lg-12">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/n00bzunit3d/autopsy.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

We filter by text documents and we find the flag.txt contains
```
156 60 60 142 172 173 67 150 63 137 154 60 156 147 137 64 167 64 61 164 63 144 137 144 61 65 153 137 146 60 162 63 156 163 61 143 65 175
```
These are obviously encodings of some kind. Converting to ASCII values yields no results. Next stop, hexadecimal to ascii - no luck. And now for the number system I honestly forget exists most the time - octal. Converting octal to ascii gives us the flag.

P.S: The `flag2.txt` file was for a challenge that was never released.
