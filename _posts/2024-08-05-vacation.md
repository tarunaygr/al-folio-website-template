Welcome to my series of writeups for n00bzunit3d 2024 capture-the-flag competition. In this post, we look at Rev/vacation. The challenge gives us a `.ps1` Windows powershell cmdlet file and an `output.txt` file. Let's see what's in them.

run.ps1
```powershell
$bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes((cat .\flag.txt))
[System.Collections.Generic.List[byte]]$newBytes = @()
$bytes.ForEach({
    $newBytes.Add($_ -bxor 3)
    })
$newString =  [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString($newBytes)
echo $newString | Out-File -Encoding ascii .\output.txt
```
output.txt

```

```

Looking at `run.ps1` we see that it reads `flag.txt` as ascii characters and XORs each byte with `3`and then stores the output in `output.txt`. XOR is a reversible operation. XORing each byte of the output with `3` should give us back the original flag. We ran the same script and pasted the output in our own `flag.txt` and the flag was present in `output.txt`.
