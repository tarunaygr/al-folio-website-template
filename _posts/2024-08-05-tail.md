Welcome to my series of writeups for n00bzunit3d 2024 capture-the-flag competition. In this post, we look at the `OSINT/tail` challenge. We are given a `tail.jpg` of a flight tail that looks like a blue flower and the flag is the aiport IATA  code of the airport the airlines operates out of.
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-5 mt-md-0 col-lg-8 mb-5">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/n00bzunit3d/tail.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I just search Google for "airlines with blue flower logo" and one of the results was for Air Tahiti, whose logo matches the photo given. It operates out of Tahiti Faa'a International Airport (PPT) and that was the flag.
