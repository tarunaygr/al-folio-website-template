Welcome to my series of writeups for n00bzunit3d 2024 capture-the-flag competition. In this post, we look at the forensics/plane challenge. We are given a `plane.jpg` and the flag is the coordinates of where this photo was taken rounded to 2 decimal places.
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-5 mt-md-0 col-lg-8 mb-5">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/n00bzunit3d/plane.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

This information can be easily retrieved from the EXIF information of the photo. You can any number of ways to view that information. We opened the file in <a href="https://www.geocords.com/photo-location/">geocords</a> and easily got the latitude and longitude.
