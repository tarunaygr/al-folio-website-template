Welcome to my series of writeups for n00bzunit3d 2024 capture-the-flag competition. In this post, we look at the `crypto/vinegar` and `crypto/vinegar2` challenges. 

Let's start with `crypto/vinegar`. 

The challenge provides us with the encrypted flag and a key.

```
Encrypted flag: nmivrxbiaatjvvbcjsf
Key: secretkey
```

Assuming the encryption algorithm is Vigenère (sounds like vinegar), we pass the information to any online Vigenère decyptor such as <a href="https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher">cryptii</a> and it gives us the flag.
